# Virus Simulator
This is a simulator written in javascript that calculates the cases and spread of a virus or disease given parameters. It graphs and displays the data including total cases, active cases, immune population and deaths. Customizable variables include:
 - Population
 - Initial Infections
 - Number of days to run simulation for
 - Rate of spread
 - Period of time after a person is infected that they are contagious
 - Vaccination rate
 - Number of days into the simulation that vaccinations occur
 - How long a person is immune for after they have been infected/vaccinated
 - Death rate
 
 **this simulation in no way should be used as an alternative to real epidemiology models**
 
 I originally created this project on glitch.com and it can be found at http://virussimulator.glitch.me/ or https://glitch.com/~virussimulator
